> "Generally speaking, there are two things I've found in my long life which you never do. One is, never feel sorry for yourself. If your child is dying of cancer, don't feel sorry for yourself. NEVER, ever, feel sorry for yourself. And the other thing you never want to have, is envy. That's the only one of the deadly sins you're never going to have any fun at at all. Pick one of the others."
