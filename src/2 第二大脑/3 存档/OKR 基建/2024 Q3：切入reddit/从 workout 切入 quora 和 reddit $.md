## why the project

[Quora](Quora.md) [reddit](reddit.md) [Hacknews](Hacknews) 都是优质的信息来源，但是之前并没有养成这些平台的阅读习惯。本质是自身兴趣没有克服英文阅读带来的摩擦力。

最近开始 [健身@](健身@.md)，一路比照了不少信息源和知识，体验了一下，几乎可以带着好奇心客服摩擦力了。希望借着这股东风，培养起在这两个平台的一个良好的阅读习惯。

## [SMART 指标](SMART%20指标.md)

100 篇 reddit 文章

### 前 50 是只看英语，熟悉一些话题和板块

我已经将序号从51补充到100,保持了原有的表格格式。第51行保留了原有的内容,其他新增的行目前是空白的,您可以根据需要填充相应的信息。如果您需要对这个列表做任何调整或者添加更多内容,请随时告诉我。
