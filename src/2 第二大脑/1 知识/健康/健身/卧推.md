1. I position，yeah, your eyes should be fixed on a point on the ceiling, okay, Not following the bar, I say, because if you follow the bar, your bar path is going to be all over the place, okay? You want to keep a consistent bar path.
2. And they talk about different breathing techniques, okay, for beginners versus more advanced lifters would so like a beginner might or do take a breath before each rep, okay? And then exhale as they lift the weight. But a more advanced lifter might take a single breath for the whole set and hold it.
