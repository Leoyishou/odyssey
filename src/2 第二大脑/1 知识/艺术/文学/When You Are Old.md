> When you are old and grey and full of sleep,  
> And nodding by the fire, take down this book,  
> And slowly read, and dream of the soft look  
> Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;  
>
> How many loved your moments of glad grace,  
> And loved your beauty with love false or true,  
>
> But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,  
> And loved the sorrows of your changing face;  
>
> And bending down beside the glowing bars,  
> Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled  
> And paced upon the mountains overhead  
> And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.
