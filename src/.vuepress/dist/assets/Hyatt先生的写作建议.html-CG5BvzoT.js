Sometimes, a writer uses good English and has no mistakes on Lang-8.  However, sometimes we tend to use &quot;and&quot; too frequently. This can make a sentence confusing.  Red indicates errors; blue indicates correct sentences. For example:</p><p>Tom and Haibo arrived and Ann and Mary were late.</p><p>Here, &quot;and&quot; is used too many time.  I would not use &quot;as well as&quot; in this case, but it is a good example of a confusing sentence that uses &quot;and&quot; too many times.  Here&#39;s a better version:</p><p>Tom and Haibo arrived; however, Ann and Mary were late.</p><p>The word &quot;and&quot; can be used too many times and in a way that makes a sentence confusing.</p><p>We had potatoes and gravy for supper and pie and ice cream for dessert.</p><p>This sentence works better with &quot;as well as.&quot;</p><p>We had potatoes and gravy for supper as well as pie and ice cream for dessert.</p><p>As you can see, the second sentence is easier to understand.  Here&#39;s a more complex example:</p><p>During the experiments we established 40 plots with a radius and within those plots we identified and counted all vascular plant species and also took 5 randomly placed soil samples and measured soil chemistry variables.</p><p>This sentence is best broken up with &quot;in addition&quot; or made into two sentences.  But it is clearer with &quot;as well as&quot; in a few places.  As usual, it can be written in several ways as follows:</p><p>Using &quot;in addition:&quot;</p><p>During the experiments we established 40 plots with a radius and within those plots we identified and counted all vascular plant species; in addition, took 5 randomly placed soil samples and measured soil chemistry variables.</p><p>Using &quot;as well as:&quot;</p><p>During the experiments we established 40 plots with a radius and within those plots we identified as well as counted all vascular plant species and also took 5 randomly placed soil samples as well as measured soil chemistry variables.</p><p>During the experiments we established 40 plots with a radius and within those plots we identified and counted all vascular plant species as well as took 5 randomly placed soil samples and measured soil chemistry variables.</p><p>Avoiding using a run-on sentence (see the standard not about &quot;run-on sentences&quot;) by using short sentences:</p><p>During the experiments we established 40 plots with a radius. Within those plots we identified and counted all vascular plant species. We also took 5 randomly placed soil samples and measured soil chemistry variables.</p><p>This last one is probably best!</p><p>I also added this comment without realized I&#39;d already written the above text!</p><p>Use &quot;as well as&quot; when there are too many &quot;ands&quot; in a sentence. For example, &quot;I like dogs and cats and wild animals such birds and mice&quot; is better if written as &quot;I like dogs and cats as well as wild animals such birds and mice.&quot;  As another example, &quot;Climatic data related to mean annual temperature and rain and soil conditions such as pH, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total organic matter content were measured&quot; works better when written as &quot;Climatic data related to mean annual temperature and rain as well as soil conditions such as pH, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total organic matter content were measured.&quot;</p><p>The phrases &quot;along with,&quot; &quot;while,&quot; and some other can be used in this way.  &quot;Climatic data related to mean annual temperature and rain were measured while a soil test kit was used to check soil conditions such as pH, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total organic matter content.&quot;</p><p>It never hurts to have plenty of examples</p><h2 id="_7-alternative-wording" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_7-alternative-wording"><span>7 ALTERNATIVE WORDING</span></a></h2><p>Sometimes, a writer uses good English and has no mistakes on Lang-8.  However, there are always new ways to say almost anything.  Rather than make corrections, I may change the wording and say, &quot;This is alternative wording&quot; meaning, &quot;You made no mistakes but here is another way to say that.  For example, here are several ways to say the same thing.（有时候，Lang-8 上的作者英语运用的相当好了，也没有错误。然而，总是有新的表达方式来描述相似的意思。不是要去改正句子的错误，我会去改正句子的措辞或者语序，&quot; 这是个可供选择的用法 &quot;。这意味这 &quot; 你在写句子时并没有犯错误，只是这儿还有另一种方法来描述它 &quot;。比如说，下面就展示了很多方式来描述同一个东西。）</p><p>The bird landed on the bird feeder outside my kitchen window, grabbed a seed, and flew away.</p><p>Outside my kitchen window, the bird landed on the feeder, picked up a seed, and took off.</p><p>The bird swooped in and dashed to the feeder, stole a single seeds, headed back to the hills.</p><p>A bird flapped into the feeder, landing lightly, selecting a seed, checking it with a tap, and dashed for the protection of the bushes.</p><p>As you can see, there are many ways to say that.  As I loved to say in high school, &quot;In math 2 + 2 always equals 4, but in English there are a thousand right ways and a thousand wrong ways to say something.&quot;（诚然，有很多方式描绘同种事物。我高中的时候就很喜欢说：&quot;2+2=4，那是数学。在英语里面，这有无数种正确的或错误的方式去表达同种意思 &quot;。）</p><p>## 8 APPOSITIVES（同位语）</p><p>Appositives are strange little things many non-native and native speakers of English never master (hence this note).  What is an appositive?  Who cares?  What I want to know is how to write good English, not a bunch of grammatical terms!</p><p>An appositive is a word or phrase that repeats the noun or pronoun that is provided before the appositive in the sentence.</p><p>Here&#39;s some examples of nouns and appositives.  Then I will use them in sentences to show you how they work.</p><p>NOUN or PRONOUN (including phrases) -- APPOSITIVE (including phrases)（名词或代词（包括短语）-- 同位语（包括短语））</p><p>black dog -- the dog that bit me</p><p>woman -- the one in the red dress</p><p>singing frog -- the frog on the rock</p><p>iceberg -- the one that would sink the Titanic</p><p>The black dog, the dog that bit me, has still not been captured.</p><p>That woman, the one in the red dress, is my beautiful wife.</p><p>The singing frog, the frog on the rock, is calling for a mate.</p><p>That iceberg, the one that would sink the Titanic, was probably calved off the coast of Greenland.</p><p>What you need to know is that appositives are &quot;set off&quot; by commas. Use a comma before and after an appositive in a sentence. Then you will be positively right!（你需要注意的是同位语需要和标点符号来使用（如之前的破折号和逗号），同位语的开头和结尾都需要加上标点。然后你就可以写出正确的同位语了。）</p><p>## 9 BECAUSE</p><p>The word &quot;because&quot; sometimes creates problems for Chinese writers of English. For example, look at this &quot;sentence.&quot;  I say &quot;sentence&quot; because it is not a complete sentence.</p><p>Because I am busy treating some calculated data.</p><p>This is not a complete sentence because something else is needed.  Here are some ways to make it a complete thought and sentence.</p><p>Because I am busy treating some calculated data, I&#39;ve not sent you an email.</p><p>Because I am busy treating some calculated data, my girlfriend feels neglected.</p><p>I can&#39;t meet you for lunch, because I am busy treating some calculated data.</p><p>My dog bit me, because I am busy treating some calculated data.</p><p>Because I am busy treating some calculated data, I should be able to trick the bank into sending me some extra money.</p><p>Obviously, something is happening because of something else.  You can&#39;t have one without the other.</p><h2 id="_10-besides-aside-from" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_10-besides-aside-from"><span>10 BESIDES / ASIDE FROM</span></a></h2><p>My Chinese friends sometimes use &quot;Besides&quot; when I know that &quot;Aside from&quot; works better.  In oral English, the two phrases are fairly interchangeable.  But in formal English, &quot;aside from&quot; often works better at the beginning of a sentence.  The two phrases are often interchangeable.  So, I&#39;ll just give an example of what I like and don&#39;t like.  It is a matter of style.</p><p>Preferred (我喜欢的使用：):</p><p>Aside from football, I don&#39;t watch many sports on TV.</p><p>Aside from her, I don&#39;t have any female friends.</p><p>Aside from cats and dogs, I really like having pets.</p><p>Aside from the guy that hit me, I also don&#39;t like you very much anyway.</p><p>Aside from supper, I also burned the cake.</p><p>Sounds odd to me (我觉得别扭的使用：):</p><p>Besides football, I don&#39;t watch many sports on TV.</p><p>Besides her, I don&#39;t have any female friends.</p><p>Besides cats and dogs, I really like having pets.</p><p>Besides, I don&#39;t like you very much anyway.</p><p>Besides, I burned the cake.</p><h2 id="_11-chinese-and-english-fonts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_11-chinese-and-english-fonts"><span>11 Chinese and English fonts</span></a></h2><p>Chinese and English fonts (also applies to other languages such as Japanese):</p><p>SEE &quot;Punctuation&quot;</p><h2 id="_12-contractions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_12-contractions"><span>12 Contractions</span></a></h2><p>I often say &quot;Contractions are our friends!&quot;  Why?  Because my Chinese friends often neglect them and the contractions get lonely as a result!  Ha!</p><p>Seriously, use contractions to make your English sound more normal.  Example: I won&#39;t do that.</p><p>Do not use contractions if you want to emphasize &quot;not.&quot;  For example: You want me to kill the kittens so we don&#39;t have to find homes for them?  I will not do that!&quot;</p><h2 id="_13-dashes-short-version" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_13-dashes-short-version"><span>13 Dashes (short version)</span></a></h2><p>Hyphen (-): Use for hyphenated words and hyphenate names.

I take a unique approach. Here are some examples:</p><p>Dependent clause examples (not complete sentences):<br> When I woke up this morning.After I ate breakfast.<br> Soon after I woke up.<br> While that dog may look nice.<br> As the bird hit the window.</p><p>In dependent clause examples (complete sentences):<br> When I woke up this morning, the dog bit me.<br> After I ate breakfast, I took a nap.<br> Soon after I woke up, it started raining.<br> While that dog may look nice, it chased me down the street and tried to bite my leg.<br> As the bird hit the window, the cat grabbed for it.</p><p>Dependent clauses are not complete sentences because the action is not completed.</p><h2 id="_17-howdy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_17-howdy"><span>17 HOWDY</span></a></h2><p>&quot;Howdy&quot; is an informal greeting use in the south central and southwestern parts of the U.

What do they look like?</p><p>Chinese fonts：？，》，《，&quot;，：，}，{，】，【，=，+，_，)，(，，&amp;，^，%，$，#，@，!，~，（note that I&#39;ve coreectly added NO space with the Chinese symbols）。</p><p>English fonts:?, &gt;, &lt;, &quot;,:, }, {,],[, =, +, _,), (,, &amp;, ^, %, $, #, @,!, (note the correct use of a space after every symbol.</p><p>As you can see, they are often quite different.  Chinese people who write English often forget to put a space after a period or comma,for example,like I just did.This makes their writing look childish (see my &quot;Little things&quot; blog for details). Chinese periods and commas have extra space，and also look different，（like you can see in this sentence）。The Chinese period is a circle and looks like this。so avoid using it with English.  It looks really bad on resumes to mix Chinese fonts with English.  It immediately shouts to the reader &quot;I&#39;m not really good at writing English。&quot;Avoid mixing Chinese fonts with English like I did intentionally in this paragragh.  Also, use a space after a period or comma (and before and after parenthesis) as required.</p><p>As a professional editor, Chinese writers of English often fail to put a space behind a comma, period, or other punctuation like we do in English. Instead, they pay me $10 a page to fix their errors, sometimes more and sometimes less. Chinese fonts have their own space made into the character itself. If you move your cursor over a Chinese or English character for punctuation, you will see English fonts need you to hit the space bar, but Chinese fonts for punctuation already provide extra space.  You don&#39;t have to hit the space bar. English punctuation:,;.!? Chinese punctuation：，；，！？In the English punctuation I provided, I have not added any spaces. English punctuation with spaces:,;.!? As an editor of scientific manuscripts I&#39;m constantly having to look for Chinese fonts that have been left in manuscripts written in English. Scientific journals will want all the Chinese fonts removed. It&#39;s a good lesson to learn in both languages. That is, use Chinese for Chinese and English for English.</p><p>## 32 RUN-ON SENTENCES</p><p>Many Chinese writers of English have been taught, incorrectly, that long sentences are better than short sentences.  What is true is that well written long sentences are better than poorly written short sentences.  My topic here is not long sentences but &quot;run-on&quot; sentences.  The easiest way to explain a run on sentence is to write one.  Here&#39;s a good example of a run-on sentence.</p><p>This sentence, an example of a run-on sentence, is far too long, this is because I have used commas to separate sentences instead of period, so that by writing many phrases and connecting them with commas, I am creating a run on sentence; sometimes you can use a semicolon correctly to separate independent like I&#39;m doing here; that can create a run-on sentence too, as you can see this run on sentence still has no end because it keeps running on and on and on and on and on which gets very tedious after a while because your mind wants the sentence to end, and it never does seem to end, that&#39;s because the author has used incorrectly to connect a variety of phrases that should end with periods.</p><p>Here are some better ways to make sentences long.  Also see my note below on the use of semicolons.</p><ol><li><p>If connecting two complete sentences into one, a semicolon often works; this sentence is a good example.</p></li><li><p>If only one part of the sentence has a full subject and verb and the rest are dependent clauses, that can work well.  Here&#39;s an example: The boy waited, his hands dripping water, the sweat on his head making wish he was next, watching the boy in front of the line grab the rope, swing over the water, and dive into the river, like he himself wanted to do again.</p></li></ol><h2 id="_33-semicolons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_33-semicolons"><span>33 Semicolons</span></a></h2><p>Use a semicolon (😉 to separate two &quot;independent clauses.&quot;</p><p>An independent clause is a clause that can be a sentence.  Examples:</p><p>Dependent clauses (cannot be sentences by themselves):</p><p>The boy in the blue hat...</p><p>... sat on a log.</p><p>... because he was lonely.</p><p>... and then it started to rain.</p><p>Independent clauses:</p><p>The boy sat in the blue hat sat on a long because he was lonely.</p><p>And then it started to rain.</p><p>The boy sat in the blue hat sat on a long because he was lonely; and then it started to rain.</p><h2 id="_35-that" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_35-that"><span>35 That</span></a></h2><p>The word &quot;that&quot; can often be deleted without changing the sentence&#39;s meaning.  Professional writers for magazines and scientific journals tend to remove it.</p><p>Compare these sentences.</p><p>I don&#39;t believe that!  The study included a method that used freezing temperatures.  I do believe that rich people are usually not that happy.  I think that you should learn from this experience.  He did it so that his girlfriend would be happy.  I have something that will keep you smiling.</p><p>I don&#39;t believe what you said!  The study included a method using freezing temperatures.  I do believe rich people are usually not very happy.  I think you should learn from this experience.  He did it so his girlfriend would be happy.  I have something which will keep you smiling.</p><p>Note: The word can be used.  But often it is not needed or the meaning is clearer if some other word is used.  Professional writers avoid it.  Editors cut it out to save space.</p><h2 id="_36-time-units" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_36-time-units"><span>36 Time units</span></a></h2><p>What is a time unit? Anything that describes time  can be considered a time unit. Some words that represent time units are quite obvious:   today, tomorrow,  yesterday,  in a few minutes, in an hour or so, and so on.   Other time units are not as obvious.  For example, I also consider the following phrases to be time units: anyway,  some time, after a while,  later, and so on.  When writing in English  you should separate time units from the rest of the sentence by a comma. Time units usually go at the  beginning or the end  of a sentence, but are often correct anywhere in the sentence. Here are some correct examples:</p><p>Yesterday, I went to the store.   I went to the store, yesterday. I went, yesterday, to the store. Tomorrow, I will go to school. Anyway, I&#39;m waiting for the weekend.  Someday, I hope to go to China.</p><p>Time units include introductory words such as:</p><p>Today, I am writing a blog.<br> Tomorrow, I will write a blog.<br> Yesterday, I wrote a blog.<br> Last week, I kissed a dog.<br> Sometime, I should wash my lips.<br> Anytime, you can kiss me!</p><p>This rule also applies to introductory words. These act like time units and are also normally separated by a comma within a sentence.</p><p>Specifically, I should not have said that.<br> However, I already said it.<br> Therefore, my wife probably won&#39;t kiss me.<br> In addition, the cat won&#39;t lick me.<br> Moreover, I don&#39;t think I want to kiss the dog again.<br> Anyway, I hope you understand.</p><h2 id="_37-title-format" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_37-title-format"><span>37 Title format</span></a></h2><p>TITLE FORMAT</p><p>Title format: short and sweet!  Long titles are tedious. My Chinese friends use a variety of informal titles for blogs. I tend to teach the formal use of English. Formal titles  are what would be used for scientific journal articles, magazine articles, and newspaper headlines. the rules are fairly simple.  Titles should be short, rather than long and should usually not ask questions.  There are exceptions to every rule.  The major words in a title should be capitalized.  Here are some examples from today&#39;s newspaper.</p><p>Israel Strike Kills 11 Civilians (contains an error!)</p><p>EPA Turns Down States&#39; Request for Ethanol Waiver</p><p>School Official Loses Appeal on Sexual Abuse Reporting</p><p>Norfork Council Sets Meeting Agenda</p><p>Library to Close for Thanksgiving</p><p>Consumers Hesitant to Upgrade to Windows 8</p><p>Note the use of capital letters on most, but not all, words.  The error?  It should be Isreali Strike Kills 11 Civilians.</p><p>The rules are never set in stone, and this is especially true for poetry.  Some people will capitalize the first letter of ALL words in a title.  Others will only capitalize the first letter of the first word and of proper nouns.  It is your choice, since it is a matter of style.</p><h2 id="_37-new" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_37-new"><span>37 (new)</span></a></h2><p>Want, will, and would like</p><p>This note is about a finer point of English, providing more detail than most.  I want to explain the meanings of &quot;want,&quot; &quot;will,&quot; and &quot;would like.&quot;</p><p>The word want in English can be a little strong in formal English, but the meaning can change based on how you say something.  I might say, &quot;I want to go to the store later,&quot; and it simply expresses that desire.  If I tell someone loudly in a strong voice, &quot;I want your wallet,&quot; it implies that I am a thief and I will force you to give me your wallet if you don&#39;t hand it to me.&quot;  I might say, &quot;I want some ice cream,&quot; and it simply tells you want I want to eat.  However, if you first tell me, &quot;We are out of money.  We need to get out of the store,&quot; and I say, &quot;But, I want some ice cream&quot; it means, &quot;I don&#39;t care if we can&#39;t afford it.  I want it anyway!&quot;</p><p>The word &quot;will&quot; is a little stronger.  &quot;I will get some ice cream anyway,&quot; expresses my desire to buy it despite the fact we can&#39;t afford it.  However, it does not always have a strong meaning.  the word &quot;will&quot; is part of the contraction &quot;I&#39;ll.&quot;  So, if I say, &quot;I&#39;ll go to the store later,&quot; I&#39;m just stating a fact.  However, if you tell me we can&#39;t afford ice cream and I say, &quot;Well, I will buy it anyway,&quot; it means I am going to use my own power, my will, to override the fact we can&#39;t afford it and I will by it anyway, whether you like it or not.  I&#39;m told the Germans use &quot;will&quot; in this way and use &quot;mochte&quot; to say &quot;I would like.&quot;</p><p>That brings us to our third phrase, &quot;would like.&quot;  If you are writing a letter or trying to be extra polite, use &quot;would like.&quot;  If we are in the store, and I tell my wife, &quot;But I would like to buy some ice cream&quot; it means, &quot;I know we can&#39;t afford it, but it is my desire to buy some ice cream if you would agree.&quot;  So, if you write, &quot;I want to introduce myself....&quot; in a letter, you can make it more polite by saying &quot;I would like to introduce myself....&quot;</p><h2 id="_38-whole-vs-entire" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_38-whole-vs-entire"><span>38 WHOLE VS ENTIRE</span></a></h2><p>Sometimes I have difficulty explaining why one word works and another does not.  This is true for &quot;whole&quot; and &quot;entire.&quot;  I think the concept is one of informal vs formal English.  In my editing of scientific research papers I often find myself replacing &quot;whole&quot; with &quot;entire&quot; simply because &quot;entire&quot; sounds better.  I don&#39;t know why!  Example:</p><p>This whole group of species is crepuscular.</p><p>This entire group of species is crepuscular.</p><p>When I&#39;m talking about a group of anything in scientific writing, I tend to use &quot;entire&quot; and not &quot;whole&quot; although both words work fairly well.  I come across this often enough on Lang-8 that I added to my list here.  While it is partly my style, I think &quot;entire&quot; is used more frequently in this context.  I hope my entire group of Lang-8 friends enjoys this list of suggestions for non-native speakers of English.</p><h2 id="_39-words-series-respectively" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_39-words-series-respectively"><span>39 Words Series/Respectively</span></a></h2><p>2) Words in a series: Words can be written in a series correctly in two ways.

You could read the second meaning (blue text) to mean &quot;Cats and mice both eat mice and grain&quot; which is not the meaning you intended. Also, the second sentence could mean Obama and Putin are twin girls who dance all night or that four people dance all night (the meaning is confusing).</p><p>RESPECTIVELY:</p><p>Note the word &quot;respectively&quot; allows you to match up two series of words.  Based on the sentence you know dogs eat meat and mice eat grain.</p><p>Why not say &quot;Dogs eat meat, cats eat mice, and mice eat grain?&quot;  The word respective is used to save space and make the meaning more clear. This is especially true in long and complex scientific writing.  Consider the following example, with and without the use of &quot;respectively.&quot;</p><p>Shorter, clearer, and better: The results
