- "manager sorting algorithm" => "managing sorting algorithms."_

## 总结与建议

1. **整体观察**
    
    - 您的口语中体现出能使用一些稍复杂的词汇（如 _algorithm_、_probabilistic_、_transformer_ 等），并且能表达一定抽象概念，说明思路相对开阔。
    - 但也可以看到**句子结构**常常凌乱或不完整，**口头填充词** ("uh," "you know," "like") 较多，**语法**（时态、主谓一致、冠词、短语搭配）及**发音**的准确度都有提升空间。
122. **改进方向**
    
    - **简化长句，突出主干**：尤其是当想表达复杂概念时，先用一个主干句说出核心逻辑，再补充修饰细节，避免一口气塞进太多成分。
    - **减少重复、口头语**：尝试减少 “uh, um, you know” 等填充，代之以短暂停顿。
    - **强化常见时态与句型**：如现在完成时、一般过去时等，熟练掌握后能更准确地陈述经历与观点。
    - **发音与单词稳定性**：同一个单词力求每次都相对一致的发音。集中记忆高频词汇的正确发音。
123. **练习方式**
    
    - **录音自查**：就像这次对话后逐句复盘，找出常错点，集中攻克。
    - **口头表述先列提纲**：先在脑海里或纸上简单列出逻辑顺序，再开口说，减少卡顿。
    - **模仿与跟读**：选择一些地道音频资料（TED 演讲、播客等），跟读或复述，模仿原句的结构与语调。
    - **注重反馈与纠正**：可以借助 AI 或请懂英语的朋友听，并指出错误，及时修正。

通过以上针对性训练，相信您的口语会在逻辑、准确度和流利度上都有显著提升。祝学习顺利、进步加速!
